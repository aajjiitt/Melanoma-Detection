# Project Name
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis

## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Conclusions
Observation:
 - training accuray ~91% and validation acuuracy ~82%
 - Verified with drop out it reduces overfitting. 


## Technologies Used
- Python - Python 3.10.2
- numpy - 1.21.5
- seaborn - 0.11.2
- matplotlib - 3.4.3
- Pandas - 1.3.4
